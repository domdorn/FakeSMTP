Overview

 FakeSMTP is a Free Fake SMTP Server with GUI for testing emails in applications easily. It is written in Java.\
Configure your application to use "localhost" as your SMTP server, and all emails will be intercepted and displayed in this software.

 FakeSMTP uses {{{http://code.google.com/p/subethasmtp/}SubEtha SMTP}}: an easy-to-use server-side SMTP library for Java.\
FakeSMTP is free to use for commercial and non-commercial projects and the source code is provided.\
It is licensed under the very free BSD or GPL license, whichever you prefer.


* Requirements

 You need Java JVM 1.6 or newer installed on your machine.\
If you are on a "Unix-like" machine (Mac, GNU/Linux, BSD...), you may have to be "root" to start the port 25, otherwise, try another port >= 1024.


* Usage

 The fakeSMTP.jar is auto-executable.\
If your desktop environment supports it, you can directly double click on the .jar file.\
Otherwise, run the following command:

+--
 java -jar fakeSMTP.jar
+--

 If you want to specify the directory where emails will be saved when starting the application,\
you can use the -o argument:

+--
 java -jar fakeSMTP.jar -o output_directory_name
+--

 You can also start the SMTP server automatically at launch (-s argument) on a different port (-p argument) with no gui (-b argument),\
the following example will autostart the SMTP server on the port 2525 and bound to the loopback address (-a argument):

+--
 java -jar fakeSMTP.jar -s -b -p 2525 -a 127.0.0.1
+--

 If you don't need to save emails on the filesystem (to improve the overall performances), you can use the `-m` (memory mode) argument:

+--
 java -jar fakeSMTP-VERSION.jar -m
+--

 To see the available options (relay domains, custom eml-viewer...), run:

+--
 java -jar fakeSMTP.jar --help
+--

 FakeSMTP was created because we couldn't find any free (as in freedom) and cross-platform SMTP server with GUI for testing emails in applications or websites.\
